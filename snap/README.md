This directory contains all of the files required to build a ZAP [snap].

Docker is used to build the snap as `snapcraft` is only supported on a limited number of Linux distros.

In order to build the snap run:

`./build-snap.sh`

To install the snap you've built locally run:

`snap install zaproxy_<version>_amd64.snap --dangerous --classic`

Where `<version>` is the version of the snap, defined in [snapcraft.yaml].
Note that the architecture component `_amd64` may be different on your system.

You should then be able to run the ZAP snap using:

`zaproxy`

In order to publish the snap you will need appropriate permissions.
Those people who have then can upload the snap using:

```
snapcraft login
snapcraft upload zaproxy_<version>_amd64.snap
```
